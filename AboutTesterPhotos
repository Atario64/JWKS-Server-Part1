I had tried reaching out to get help about the errors I was getting and tried using things like Copilot to troubleshoot the problem on my own but I have reached a deadend as it says I need some other executable to test my server. 
I am willing to add the screenshots of the actual test if I were to get help making it work properly but for now I am just going to provide the error message that I was getting.
